# 0x00. Pascal's Triangle

## Description
This project focuses on implementing a function `pascal_triangle(n)` that generates Pascal's triangle of size `n`. The function returns a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row of Pascal's triangle. 

## Task
### Task 0: Pascal's Triangle
Create a function `def pascal_triangle(n):` that returns a list of lists of integers representing Pascalâ€™s triangle of `n`:

- Returns an empty list if `n <= 0`.
- It is assumed that `n` will always be an integer.

## Directory Structure
- Directory: 0x00-pascal_triangle
- File: 0-pascal_triangle.py

Please refer to the respective file in the directory for the implementation of the function.

## Usage
To use the function `pascal_triangle(n)`, follow these steps:

1. Import the function:
from pascal_triangle import pascal_triangle

2. Call the function with the desired value of n:
triangle = pascal_triangle(5)

3. The variable triangle will contain the generated Pascal's triangle.

## Example
triangle = pascal_triangle(5)
print(triangle)

Output:
[[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [1, 3, 3, 1], [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]]
