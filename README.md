## Projects

### Pascal's Triangle

This project focuses on implementing a function `pascal_triangle(n)` that generates Pascal's triangle of size `n`. The function returns a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row of Pascal's triangle. 

### Lockboxes

This project focuses on implementing a function `canUnlockAll(boxes)` that determines if all the boxes in a list of lists can be opened. Each box is numbered sequentially from 0 to `n - 1` and each box may contain keys to the other boxes. The function returns `True` if all boxes can be opened, else it returns `False`.

### Minimum Operations

This project focuses on solving the minimum operations problem using text editing operations. The goal is to calculate the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n occurrences of the character 'H' in a text file.

### Log Parsing

This project focuses on implementing a script that reads `stdin` line by line and computes metrics. The script computes the following metrics:
  - Total file size
  - Number of lines by status code
  - Number of lines by status code, and sorted by the status code in ascending order

### UTF-8 Validation

This project focuses on implementing a function `validUTF8(data)` that determines if a given data set represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.

### N Queens

This project focuses on solving the N queens problem. The N queens problem is the challenge of placing N non-attacking queens on an NÃ—N chessboard. The function `nqueens(n)` returns a list of lists containing all the possible solutions to the problem.

### Star Wars API

This project focuses on making HTTP requests to the [Star Wars API](https://swapi-api.alx-tools.com/).

### Rotate 2D Matrix

This project focuses on implementing a function `rotate_2d_matrix(matrix)` that rotates a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise.

### Island Perimeter

This project focuses on implementing a function `island_perimeter(grid)` that returns the perimeter of the island described in `grid`.
