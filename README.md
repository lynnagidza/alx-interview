This repository contains projects that focus on preparing for a technical interview process.

## Projects

### 0x00-pascal_triangle

This project focuses on implementing a function `pascal_triangle(n)` that generates Pascal's triangle of size `n`. The function returns a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row of Pascal's triangle. 

### 0x01-lockboxes

This project focuses on implementing a function `canUnlockAll(boxes)` that determines if all the boxes in a list of lists can be opened. Each box is numbered sequentially from 0 to `n - 1` and each box may contain keys to the other boxes. The function returns `True` if all boxes can be opened, else it returns `False`.

### 0x02-minimum_operations

This project focuses on solving the minimum operations problem using text editing operations. The goal is to calculate the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n occurrences of the character 'H' in a text file.

### 0x03-log_parsing

This project focuses on implementing a script that reads `stdin` line by line and computes metrics. The script computes the following metrics:
  - Total file size
  - Number of lines by status code
  - Number of lines by status code, and sorted by the status code in ascending order

### 0x04-utf8_validation

This project focuses on implementing a function `validUTF8(data)` that determines if a given data set represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.

### 0x05-nqueens

This project focuses on solving the N queens problem. The N queens problem is the challenge of placing N non-attacking queens on an NÃ—N chessboard. The function `nqueens(n)` returns a list of lists containing all the possible solutions to the problem.

### 0x06-starwars_api

This project focuses on making HTTP requests to the [Star Wars API](https://swapi-api.alx-tools.com/).
