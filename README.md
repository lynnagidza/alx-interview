Pascal's triangle as demonstrated in Python

## Directories

### 0x00-pascal_triangle

- Description: This project focuses on implementing a function `pascal_triangle(n)` that generates Pascal's triangle of size `n`. The function returns a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row of Pascal's triangle. 

### 0x01-lockboxes

- Description: This project focuses on implementing a function `canUnlockAll(boxes)` that determines if all the boxes in a list of lists can be opened. Each box is numbered sequentially from 0 to `n - 1` and each box may contain keys to the other boxes. The function returns `True` if all boxes can be opened, else it returns `False`.
